PROGRAM 2: A switch is connected to pin P1.0 and an LED to pin P2.7. Write a program to get the status of the switch and send it to the LED.
		SETB P1.7		
	AGAIN	MOV C, P1.0		
		MOV P2.7, C

PROGRAM 3: Assume that 5 BCD data items are stored in RAM locations starting at 40H, as shown below. Write an ALP program to find the sum of all the numbers. The result must be in BCD.

		INC R7		
	NEXT	INC R0		
		DJNZ R2, AGAIN		

Program 4: Write a program to create a square wave of 50% duty cycle (with equal portions high and low) on the P1.5 bit. Timer 0 is used to generate the time delay.
		MOV TMOD, #01H		
	HERE	MOV TL0, #0F2H		
		MOV TH0, #0FFH		
		CPL P1.5		
		ACALL DELAY
